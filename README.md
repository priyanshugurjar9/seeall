Movie Recommender System
Description:
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning-based application designed to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and user experience. It uses datasets such as MovieLens and IMDB for training and evaluation.

Key features include:

Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-user and item-item similarity to suggest movies based on historical ratings and viewing patterns.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies with similar genres, actors, directors, or plot summaries to those the user has liked.

Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based methods to overcome individual limitations and cold start problems.

User Interface: An intuitive front-end allows users to input preferences, rate movies, and receive real-time recommendations.

Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently using matrix factorization (SVD) and neural network-based models.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning models)

Streamlit/Flask (for web UI)

Surprise/LightFM libraries

MovieLens/IMDB datasets
